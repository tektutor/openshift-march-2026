## Info - What happens internally in Openshift when we deploy an application
```
oc create deploy nginx --image=docker.io/bitnamilegay/nginx:latest --replicas=3
```

Note
<pre>
- oc client tool makes a REST call to API Server requesting the API Server to create a deployment
- Once API Server receives the request from oc client, it creates a Deployment database entry in etcd database
- API Server then sends broadcasting event saying new Deployment created along with deployment details
- Deployment Controller receives this event, it then makes a REST call to API Server requesting it to create a ReplicaSet for the nginx deployment
- API Server creates a ReplicaSet db entry(new record) in the etcd database
- API Server sends a broadcast event saying new ReplicaSet created
- ReplicaSet Controller receives the event, it then makes a REST call to API Server requesting it to create 3 Pods
- API Server create 3 Pod records in the etcd database
- API Server sends broadcast event for each new Pod created in the etcd database
- Scheduler receives the event, it then identifies a healthy node where the new Pod can be deployed
- Scheduler makes a REST call to API Server to send it scheduling recommendataion. This will be done for each Pod.
- API Server receives the scheduling recommendations from Scheduler, it then retrieves the Pod record from etcd and updates it status as Scheduled to so and so node
- API Server sends a broadcasting event saying Pod1 scheduled to Worker01 node, this happens for each Pod.
- Kubelet Container Agent that runs on Worker01 node receives the event, it then pull the container image, creates and starts the container on Worker01
- Kubelet monitors the status of the Container created for Pod1, and it periodically updates the status back to API Server in a heart-beat fashion
- API Server receives these updates, retrieves the Pod database entry from etcd and updates the Pod status
